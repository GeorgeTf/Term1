# Term1
Overview
This project brings together concepts from my short but extensive Data Engineering course to build a full data analytics solution in MySQL. The goal is to take a raw dataset, set up an operational and analytical layer, create an ETL pipeline, and develop data marts for quick, insightful reporting. It's been a hands-on way to see how SQL skills and database design fit into real-world data transformation and analytics.

Project Objectives
Combine Course Concepts: Linking together the SQL skills and data transformation techniques we learned to create a complete project.
Practice SQL Operations: Implementing SQL statements from class, including advanced operations like stored procedures and triggers.
The extra mile: I’ve tried to stretch beyond the course material by adding materialized views (using simulated tables) and scheduling updates.
Learn Project Structure: Practice the process of packaging, versioning, documenting, and structuring a project in a semi-professional way.

Project Structure
Operational Layer: The base layer where I imported a relational dataset from Kaggle (TechSales_Bakutech). This operational data represents our "raw" data layer and serves as the source for transformations.

Analytics Plan: Planned the types of analysis we could perform on this data:

Product sales performance
Customer demographics
Monthly sales trends
Return rates for quality analysis
Analytical Layer: Designed denormalized tables in MySQL to make it easier to calculate metrics without repetitive joins. This included tables for customer demographics, product sales trends, and return patterns.

ETL Pipeline: Developed an ETL pipeline using stored procedures and triggers:

Extract: Pulling data from operational tables.
Transform: Performing calculations like total sales, revenue, and return rate.
Load: Storing results in the analytical tables for faster queries.
Data Marts: Created views as data marts to give direct access to commonly needed metrics:

Product sales summary
Customer demographics breakdown
Product return analysis
Monthly sales trends
Materialized Views: Simulated materialized views by creating tables that store pre-computed data and scheduling them to refresh. This ensures fast access to frequently queried data, particularly useful for static datasets.

Instructions to Reproduce
Step 1: Clone the repository and set up a MySQL environment.
Step 2: Import the provided SQL script into MySQL to create tables, views, and stored procedures.
Step 3: Run the stored procedures as needed to populate the analytical tables.
Step 4: Query the data marts (views) for insights directly.
The project should run without any issues as long as you follow the setup steps. Each component, from the operational layer to the data marts, is set up to work together seamlessly.

Project Highlights
Complex Dataset: The dataset includes sales, customer, and product information, offering rich opportunities for analysis.
Advanced SQL: Includes triggers, stored procedures, and views, providing an end-to-end ETL and analytics solution.
Simulated Materialized Views: Added for faster access to precomputed metrics, something not covered directly in class.
Clear Documentation: Comments in the SQL script, and this README provide guidance on each step.
Grading Criteria Overview
Dataset Fitness: The dataset was chosen for its depth and relevance, aligning well with the analysis goals.
Complexity: Tackled a dataset with multiple tables, making it suitable for a range of analytics.
Operational Layer: Imported and structured the dataset in MySQL.
Analytics Plan: Developed a clear plan for actionable metrics.
Analytical Layer Execution: Designed denormalized tables to streamline analytics.
ETL Pipeline: Created stored procedures and triggers to automate data transformation.
Data Marts: Defined views to provide direct access to key insights.
Delivery: Structured code with clear naming and consistent formatting.
Documentation: Annotated code and provided this README for an attempt at clarity.
Reproducibility: Ensured anyone can follow the instructions to recreate the project.
Future Enhancements
I’d consider adding more robust error handling, scheduling ETL refreshes more frequently, and possibly integrating it with a reporting tool for visualization.
On a more extreme note, for future enhancement, I would try to dedicate more time to understanding each step on a fundamental and theoretical level to avoid mindless code implementations from class.
Overall very cool experience.
